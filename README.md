# üí° **What we solve**

It's not easy to manage a DAO when there are thousands of people trying to be a part of you. Managing profiles on multiple places is a big issue that many people face.
So, we present you **DAOcom**. A one stop solution to manage your DAO, contributors, publish bounty, grants and jobs. This helps in easy management as well as less hassle to get the work done.
For the contributors, we have a one stop where they can find their next target and aim for the big project. They can also build their proof of work while contributing and earn some extra bucks as well.

# Features
- DAOs can manage their contributors, their professional and reward details.
- DAOs can place bounties, jobs and grants for contributors to target.
- Lurkers and contributors can have a space to see all the available opportunities in the ecosystem.
- They can build their proof of work as well.
- We support cross chain transaction as well to have the freedom to get funds in whichever chain you want.
